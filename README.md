# Sprint 0 - Paper tower

For our first sprint we will be practicing the process of design, and submission of sprints using Github.

You will document and submit your design process in this GitHub repository. Your design process will involve all of the stages that you will show in each stage of our RoboCup project, but for this first sprint we will be working without technology.

## Goal
our goal is to create a tall paper towel without cheating
### Restrictions

- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

You will submit the instructions and diagrams that would allow another to make your designed tower, 

## Process

You will follow the steps outlined below (for both this sprint and those for our RoboCup design).

### Research

- we will try our best to look up ideas and videos online to guid and help us in our process of building our robot 

### Ideation

You will create quick sketches or descriptions of your planned design

### Prototyping

You will make a quick and simple test of your ideas, making something that is built and tested as quickly as possible.

### Testing and Critique

You will evaluate your prototype and document your thinking, what you have learned and how you will improve your design.

### Final design

You will document your final design idea in detail, with enough technical detail for another engineer to recreate your work

### Conclusion

You will make a brief comment on the success of your design and what next steps others might build on your work.
